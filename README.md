#JAVA-SCRIPT-HANGMAN-GAME

This project was all about constructing a functional game while strenghtening knowledges about html, css but focusing in particular on the Java Script part.
Giving the fact that I had to build everything from scratch gaved me the oportunity to have a better understanding of how important it is to have a solid foundation to build on and also how important the pseudocode is.
I found this challenge a bit hard with a lot of problems to overcome but also enjoyed solving them.
